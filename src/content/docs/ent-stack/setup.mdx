---

This sections shows how to quickly set up and run the ENT stack for local development. It covers prerequisites, configuring the backend (Express) and frontend (Next.js), and getting a local MySQL database running with Docker.

### Prerequisites

- **Git CLI**
- **Node.js**
- **PNPM**
- **Docker CLI** (for local MySQL database)
- A Unix-like shell environment (e.g., Bash, Zsh)

### 1/ ðŸš€ Create your project

```bash
pnpm create ent-stack
```

### 2/ ðŸ”¥ Setup

```bash
pnpm fire
```
- Installs dependencies
- Starts the local database in a Docker container
- Creates the database and tables
- Runs dev environments for both the backend and frontend

### Environment Variables

If you ran create and setup scripts, then your application should be running just fine, but email sending and testing won't work until adjust env variables listed below:
- To enable email sending, you need to **[sign up for a Resend account](https://resend.com/signup)** and set **SERVICE_EMAIL** and **RESEND_API_KEY**
- To enable email testing, you need to **[sign up for a Mailslurp account](https://app.mailslurp.com/sign-up)** and set **MAILSLURP_API_KEY**, **MAILSLURP_INBOX_ID** and **MAILSLURP_EMAIL**

Here is the list of values that **MUST BE THE SAME** in both backend and frontend **.env** files:

| Backend       | Frontend                  |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| SITE_NAME     | NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME     |
| COOKIE_DOMAIN | NEXT_PUBLIC_COOKIE_DOMAIN |
| BACKEND_URL   | NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL   |
| FRONTEND_URL  | NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL  |
| JWT_SECRET    | JWT_SECRET                |

At this point, your application should be up and running locally. Adjust values, domains, and environment settings as needed.
